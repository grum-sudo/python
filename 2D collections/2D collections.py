print(groceries[0][0])#so this is kinda cool it works like minecraft cords [0][0] prints the first item in the first list so [0][1] would print the second one

#for collection in groceries:
#    for food in collection:
#        print(food, end=", ")
#    print()#this print is just to make a new line after each collection
